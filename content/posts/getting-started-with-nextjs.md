# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 introduces some exciting new features that make building React applications even more powerful. The App Router is now stable, and there are significant improvements to performance and developer experience.

## What's New in Next.js 14?

The latest version brings several key improvements:

- **Stable App Router** - The new routing system is now production-ready
- **Server Components by Default** - Better performance out of the box
- **Improved Caching** - More granular control over data fetching

## Setting Up Your First Project

Getting started is simple:
